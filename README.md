Hello welcome to my Bank Management System repository, this is my first C/C++ project. 

I am following this tutorial (link below) I am following part 1, 2 and 3 to learn more about curses library and OOP.

To run this project:
- g++ curses.cpp -lncurses

Currently main.c and curses.cpp are not linked in any way as I am stil learning curses. But once I have created a working GUI for the bank system I will link these files
